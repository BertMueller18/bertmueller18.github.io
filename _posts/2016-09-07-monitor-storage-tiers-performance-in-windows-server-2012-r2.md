> Monitor Storage Tiers Performance in Windows Server 2012 R2

Â 
Updated: December 22, 2015
Applies To: Windows Server 2012 R2
To make sure your storage tiers are optimizing performance of your storage spaces efficiently in Windows Server 2012 R2, you should evaluate the performance of your storage configuration after a few days, when your workloads have run long enough to become established and predictable, and then check a few simple data points each week in a Storage Tier Optimization Report to make sure the storage tiers are performing optimally. Use performance counters for the Tier object to gather additional data about Reads and Writes to the tiers.

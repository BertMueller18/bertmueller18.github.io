In this post I am just highlighting some of the ways that I know of where we can download and execute code via the commandline which could be used in command injection vulnerabilities or exploiting buffer overflows using the classic ret-to-libc method. Most of you would most probably know these methods but I thought Iâ€™d post it anyway for my own reference.

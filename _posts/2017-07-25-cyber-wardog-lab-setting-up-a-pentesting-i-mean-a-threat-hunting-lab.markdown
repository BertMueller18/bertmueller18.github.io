## Setting up a Pentesting... I mean, a Threat Hunting Lab

I see a lot of articles out there showing you how to use specific tools to steal credentials, move laterally, bypass security controls and even own an entire domain. However, only a few articles share how to detect or hunt for those attacks. One of the things I feel helps me a lot to stay up to date and to learn new offensive and defensive skills, besides reading books, is having my own personal lab at home. This allows me to test or validate new attacks while at the same time learning and developing new techniques to detect and hunt for them in the real world. 

Recently I had a few friends ask me to walk them through the basics of building a threat hunting lab. Therefore, I decided to start a series of posts with the title "Setting up a Pentesting... I mean, a Threat Hunting lab" to show you how you can also start setting up your environment to not just play red team but to hunt at the same time.

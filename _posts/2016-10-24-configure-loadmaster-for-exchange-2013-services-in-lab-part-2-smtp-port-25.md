NOVEMBER 23, 2015KRISHNA - MVP	 EXCHANGE 2013, EXCHANGE 2016	LEAVE A COMMENT
In part 1 of the article series, we got Exchange 2013 configured, Hyper-V networks configured and installed LoadMaster in both the AD site and finally configure with Two-Arm networks. In this part of the article series we will configure LoadMaster for Exchange HTTPS and SMTP services. Below Figure 2.1 is the current lab setup with IP address configuration.

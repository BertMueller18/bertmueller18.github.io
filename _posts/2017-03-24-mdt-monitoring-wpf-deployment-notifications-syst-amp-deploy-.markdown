> MDT Monitoring: WPF Deployment notifications

 Damien Van Robaeys   13:24 
 
In this post, I will show you a way to monitor your MDT deployment and display a GUI when a computer is installed or when an error occurs during the deployment.
In a previous post I have shown you how to monitor your deployment and display notification using the BurnToast module.Â 
This time I used another way using a PowerShell GUI with MahApps.
This way you can use this method on Windows 10 but also on Windows 7 computers.

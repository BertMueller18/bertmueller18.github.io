## How To Secure ICA Connections in XenApp and XenDesktop 7.6 using SSL
 Andrew Cooper
Hi, Iâ€™m Andy Cooper from the Citrix Security Team. Joe Nord already introduced a new feature in XenDesktop 7.6that provides SSL security for HDX connections. Now that SSL has been integrated into the core of the VDA, enabling it is simpler than it has ever been before, and the solution scales out to large deployments while delivering the level of performance Citrix customers have come to expect. In this follow-on blog I will walk you through the essential steps for configuring SSL in a common use-case scenario, and outline some potential pitfalls. I will then show how to configure SSL for pooled, non-persistent VDI desktops.

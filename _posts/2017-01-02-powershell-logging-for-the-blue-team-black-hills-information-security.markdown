> PowerShell Logging for the Blue Team

Joff Thyer //

It is no secret that PowerShell is increasingly being used as an offensive tool for attack purposes by both Red Teamers and Criminals alike. Thanks for the efforts of a number of people in the industry, we have tools like PowerSploit, PowerShell Empire, MailSniper, and Bloodhound just to name a few of the top contenders. While most of these tools are definitely post exploitation in nature, the ability of Red Teamers, and attackers to trivially social engineer end users provides an easy path to extensive PowerShell usage.

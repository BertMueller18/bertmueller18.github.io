## From IMA to FMA: Where to Find XenApp 6.5 Features in XenApp & XenDesktop 7
 Tom De Backer
XenApp 6.5 has reachedÂ end of maintenance and with the end of life date only a few months away, migrating your existing 6.5 environment(s) to XenApp & XenDesktop 7 is highly recommended.
This also means moving from the IMA architecture to FMA. In earlier 7.x versions, some 6.5/IMA features were not available, but rest assured, they were added throughout new releases. Because some features have been rebranded or have gone through some design changes and improvements, this blog article may assist you in finding the XenApp 6.5 feature you are looking for in XenApp & XenDesktop 7.

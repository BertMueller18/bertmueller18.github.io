## POWERSHELL ACTIVE DIRECTORY DELEGATION â€“ PART 1
05/03/2018 BY STEPHANOS 3 COMMENTS

SCENARIO:
PowerShell Active Directory Delegation.

I wrote this script long ago and I use it when there are changes in Active Directory to apply delegation on the new Organizational Units. I thought that you might find it interesting, so I decided to write this post. We will go through the script and by the end of the series, you will be able to understand what the script is doing. We will divide the script smaller parts and discuss them accordingly.

In this post, Senior Application Development Manager, Danny Kolke, gives a practical guide on getting started with PowerShell and Azure CLI.

"For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them." Aristotle
In working with my customers I often run into those who want to get started with Azure but just haven't done anything yet. My encouragement with them is pretty much summed up by Aristotle's famous words, or Yoda; whichever comes first to mind. With as much foresight as Aristotle had I still doubt that he was talking about Azure; of course Yoda was. Regardless, this wisdom sure holds true for me; in my experience with Azure the best way to learn is just to start building something.

The following labs I developed as an exercise to teach Powershell and CLI for one of my customers. This customer wanted to cover things like Virtual Networks, Network Security Groups, Resource Groups, Load Balancers vs Application Gateways and how to setup failover recovery and other scenarios. But they didn't want to just learn about them, they wanted to do lots of labs. Plus this class was going to have half of the students on Windows machines and half on Mac's wanting to do both Powershell and CLI. The following is the first set of labs in a journey of labs we did together.

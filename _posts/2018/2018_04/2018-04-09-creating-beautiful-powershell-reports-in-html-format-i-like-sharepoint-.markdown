> Creating beautiful Powershell Reports in HTML-Format
8. April 2018 Karsten Schneider Administration, BI & Reporting, Powershell, SharePoint 0

Actually SharePoint Admins do a lot stuff with Powershell Scripts. Often in Powershell you get lists where data is collected in table format. Interesting for repeating Scripts you run should be the possibility to create Powershell Reports. Those Powershell based Reports are easy to create if you know how. You also can create a unique .css file to make the design for all reports identically.

Creating Powershell Reports
So if you like this idea, then you should read further more. There are a lot of posts to that topic and i started with a simple CSS file which i later used as a reference in my Powershell Script to format the output Table in the Report. The report itself is a html file. As SharePoint Admin it might be an idea, to create those reports regularly and publish it to a document library or a page, where you can see it from your desktop after update.

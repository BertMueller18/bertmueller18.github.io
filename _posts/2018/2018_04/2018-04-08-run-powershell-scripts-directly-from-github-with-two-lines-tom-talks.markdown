## Run PowerShell Scripts Directly from GitHub with Two Lines
Published	07/02/2016	- 1	Comment

First off, this is a really bad idea most of the time. You shouldn’t run scripts on your system you don’t understand/haven’t reviewed and that someone else could edit at any time.

However, it is possible to pull scripts directly from GitHub and run them on a system. Allowing you to use 2 simple lines to invoke a larger script, and to pull the latest version of a script every time.

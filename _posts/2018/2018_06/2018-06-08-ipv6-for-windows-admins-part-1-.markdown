Introduction
While most administrators of Windows-based networks are very knowledgeable IPv4 addressing, subnetting, routing, and such topics, many admins lack such confidence when it comes to similar aspects of the IPv6 networking protocol. This short series of articles is intended to walk you through some of the basics of understanding and configuring IPv6 on Windows and Windows Server systems. The explanation and procedures included below are largely adapted from my book Training Guide: Installing and Configuring Windows Server 2012 R2 (Microsoft Press, 2014). Also included at the end of this short series are some additional tips and gotchas on this subject that I've gleaned from the larger IT pro community including the almost 100,000 followers of our WServerNews weekly newsletter which you can subscribe to at http://www.wservernews.com/subscribe.htm.

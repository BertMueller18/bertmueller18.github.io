## Remove Internal Exchange Server Names and IP Addresses from Message Headers

NOVEMBER 17, 2016 BY PAUL CUNNINGHAM 24 COMMENTS

When you send an email message, the recipient can view the headers of the message and see all of the “hops” that the message went through on its journey from one mailbox to another.

The header info is very useful in troubleshooting situations, because you can copy/paste it into tools like the message analyzer in the Microsoft Remote Connectivity Analyzer and look at things like delays in message transfer between servers along the route the message took.

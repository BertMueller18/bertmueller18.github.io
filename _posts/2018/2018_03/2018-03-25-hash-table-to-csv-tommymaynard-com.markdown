Hash Table to CSV
Leave a reply
I’m was sitting here, and I wondered, how do I get a hash table into a CSV? Have I even ever done that? Now, a few commands in, and I can’t even remember why I wondered that. There was a reason, I just wish I could remember what it was. Whatever it was, I should be more likely to remember how to get a hash table into CSV when I need it after today’s post. Was on disk storage for a hash tables for some software configuration… ugh, what was it?

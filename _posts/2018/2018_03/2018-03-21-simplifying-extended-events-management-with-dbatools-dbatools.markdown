> simplifying extended events management with dbatools
POSTED ON FEBRUARY 26, 2018 BY CHRISSY LEMAIRE
Gianluca Sartori and I recently presented Simplifying Extended Events with dbatools at SQL Bits and we had a lot of fun. Not only that, we helped convince several people to switch! Honestly, when we proposed the session, I was totally #TeamProfiler. I figured if PowerShell didn’t convince me, I would let people know where I stood, but I was open to switching teams.

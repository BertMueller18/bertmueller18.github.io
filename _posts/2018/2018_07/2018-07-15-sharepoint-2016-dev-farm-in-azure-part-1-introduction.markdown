> Setting up a SharePoint 2016 dev farm in Azure – Part 1: Introduction
January 23, 2018 by Ehi Kioya Leave a Comment


 
Detailed instructions/procedure for setting up a SharePoint 2016 development or test farm. This is a multi-part article. The following posts are part of this series:

This page – Part 1: Introduction
Part 2: Domain Controller
Part 3: SQL Server
Part 4: SharePoint 2016 Installation
I have previously written two articles on setting up SharePoint development virtual machines. This one was for SharePoint 2010 while this one was for SharePoint 2013.

In both cases, I walked through all the details including OS installation, Active Directory (domain controller) setup, SQL Server installation, and of course SharePoint installation. For both the SharePoint 2010 and 2013 articles, we used the awesome autospinstaller script to automate the SharePoint part of the farm setup.

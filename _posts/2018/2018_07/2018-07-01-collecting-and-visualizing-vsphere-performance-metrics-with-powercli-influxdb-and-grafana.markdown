Introduction
Follow this guide to get up and running with CentOS 7, InfluxDB and Grafana. Once you complete this setup, you'll be collecting and displaying realtime performance metrics from your favorite API.

Note: This is a long read, at ~2300 words. It should take about an hour to get through the deployment. If you need some motivation get coffee'd up and review the example charts at the end of the post.

> ENHANCED POWERSHELL LOGGING AND SYSMON LOGS TO ELASTICSEARCH AND VISUALIZATION/DASHBOARDING USING KIBANA - PART 1 OF SERIES

So I was thinking of coming up with a quick and easy solution whereby the power of enhanced powershell logging, sysmon and Elasticsearch+KibanaÂ can be used to gain visibility during security monitoring/security analysis, into threats leveraging powershell, and at the same time these logs can be used to perform IR and malware forensics and analysis.

> Optimizing Windows and Citrix App Layering
 Rob Zylowski
I have been working with individuals and teams implementing both VDI and SBC infrastructures for going on 20 years now. Over the last 8 years with Unidesk and now Citrix Consulting, it has been intense, working with many customers on a weekly basis. I have spent a significant portion of this time concentrating on how to best configure the Windows OS to get the best user experience with the highest user density per physical host. Luckily for everyone likely to be reading this blog post, there are many talented folks also working on this same goal.

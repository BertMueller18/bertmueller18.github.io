## XenServer documentation script – Citrixlab.dk pscribo

Just before new years I uploaded my XenServer documentation script to GitHub, you can find it here:

In this post I will go through how to use the script and how to report any feedback to me. I also want to do a huge shoutout to Iain Brighton for making the PScribo module which is just awesome for report making!

Download the code from here: https://github.com/mracket/XenServer-DocumentationScript/archive/master.zip 
Download PScribo from here: https://github.com/iainbrighton/PScribo/archive/dev.zip

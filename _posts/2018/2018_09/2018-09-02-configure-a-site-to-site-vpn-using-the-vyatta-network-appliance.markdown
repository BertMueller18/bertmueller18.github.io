## Configure a Site-to-site VPN using the Vyatta Network Appliance
Last updated on: 2018-08-07 Authored by: Sameer Satyam
Introduction
Using a Vyatta Appliance, you can establish a secure site-to-site VPN connection connection between your cloud infrastructure at any Rackspace site and your data center or existing IT infrastructure location.

This site-to-site VPN connection enables you to extend your IT infrastructure to the Rackspace Cloud and “burst” extra compute requirements into the Rackspace Cloud.

Vyatta supports both policy-based and route-based VPNs. In this article we show you how to configure a policy-based VPN on the Vyatta.

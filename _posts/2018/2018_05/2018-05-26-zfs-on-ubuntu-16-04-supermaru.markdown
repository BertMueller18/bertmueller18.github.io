> ZFS on ubuntu 16.04
05/11/17 / /	 / linux	/ linux, ubuntu, zfs
On my previous post, ZFS on Ubuntu Linux, I had setup ZFS on Ubuntu 14.04 by adding a ZFS repository, installing multiple packages and such. Now on 16.04 and 16.10, it is available by simply typing:

sudo apt-get install zfs

My previous post covers how to setup a ZFS Pool, creating ZIL, and sharing the ZFS filesystem. For additional documentation on setting up ZFS, i’ll refer to this document by Aaron Toponce.

> Personal vDisks – Part 1!

Well, it’s been a while since I’ve written an article and I’ve got plenty to write about really…  I’ll start with Citrix’s latest edition to the XenDesktop family, 5.6 and Personal vDisks.  Also after writing out all I’ve discovered about Personal vDisks to date, it is too big to put into one single blog so I’ll be splitting it out into bite sized pieces, like the mini Battenberg’s Mr Whathisface does.

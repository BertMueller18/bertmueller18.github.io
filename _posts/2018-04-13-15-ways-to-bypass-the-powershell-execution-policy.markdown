> 15 Ways to Bypass the PowerShell Execution Policy
Scott Sutherland
September 9th, 2014
By default PowerShell is configured to prevent the execution of PowerShell scripts on Windows systems. This can be a hurdle for penetration testers, sysadmins, and developers, but it doesn’t have to be. In this blog I’ll cover 15 ways to bypass the PowerShell execution policy without having local administrator rights on the system. I’m sure there are many techniques that I’ve missed (or simply don’t know about), but hopefully this cheat sheet will offer a good start for those who need it.

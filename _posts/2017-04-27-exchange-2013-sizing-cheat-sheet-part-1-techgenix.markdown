Introduction
“Sizing is both a science and an art form”, so says Jeff Mealiffe in his terrific blog post Ask the Perf Guy: Sizing Exchange 2013 Deployments. Jeff reminded me of my first article on the topic of Exchange sizing, The Art and Science of Sizing Exchange 2003. The guidelines for sizing an Exchange infrastructure have evolved a lot since those early days with Exchange. Nowadays I’m not sure if it’s simpler or more complex to design an Exchange infrastructure, but one thing is for sure, we now have advanced tools like the Exchange 2013 Server Role Requirements Calculator that do all the work for us, although some basic (to say the least) understanding of the Exchange Server architecture and components is still fundamental.

> Configure VPN in Windows Server 2012 R2
by Richard Hicks [Published on 28 July 2016 / Last Updated on 28 July 2016]  


Windows Server 2012 R2 provides support for secure client-based remote access VPN connections as part of the Routing and Remote Access Services (RRAS). Client-based VPN is very mature in Windows, originally introduced with Windows 2000 Server and also as a downloadable option for Windows NT 4.0. Today, RRAS has broad client support with secure and robust VPN protocols such as IKEv2 and SSTP, while at the same time maintaining support for legacy VPN protocols such as L2TP/IPsec and PPTP.

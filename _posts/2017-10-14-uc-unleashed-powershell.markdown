> PowerShell Default Parameter Values – Time to Tweak Your Profile Again!
January 18th, 2017Pat RichardNo comments
One of the great things about a PowerShell profile is you get to customize the environment. One nice feature to accomplish this is the ability to set default parameter values for cmdlets. A great write-up about this is available at About Parameters Default Values. You can see similar info by running get-help about_Parameters_Default_Values. I’m not going to go into great detail about the feature, as those two resources are more than sufficient. What I am going to list here are some great examples that I’ve come to love. They are all in my profile.

This first example if my favorite. When you use the Get-Help cmdlet, the resulting info is shown in a popup window. This is great as I can keep it open while I work on my code in the main console window.

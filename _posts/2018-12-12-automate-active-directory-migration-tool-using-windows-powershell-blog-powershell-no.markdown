> Automate Active Directory Migration Tool using Windows PowerShell
Active Directory Migration Tool (ADMT) provides the ability to restructure Active Directory domain structures. It allows you to migrate users, groups and computers between domains, both intra-forest and inter-forest. Features includes password migration, SID migration and security translation among several others.
ADMT was recently released in version 3.2, adding support for Windows Server 2008 R2 and Managed Service Accounts. You can find the download here, and the ADMT migration guide here.

Summary: Use the Windows PowerShell 2.0 splatting technique to simplify your scripts. This step-by-step article provides the details.

 

Hey, Scripting Guy! I hope this is not a dumb question; I am a little hesitant to even ask, but something has been bugging me for over a month. I was recently in a Live Meeting with Scripting Guy Ed Wilson and he mentioned something that sounded like splatting. I searched the Windows PowerShell online help and could not find anything. I also searched the MSDN documentation and could not find anything either. What in the world is splatting—was he just being funny, or is that a real Windows PowerShell thing.

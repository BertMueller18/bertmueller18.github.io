> Console Trans-tripping!
by Hazzy on March 2, 2015 in Powershell • 0 Comments
Grumpy Monday, meh! After the thrill of the weekend coming in to work make me grumpy! Not just a case of the Monday’s!  What is worse than that, you were working in the Powershell console on Friday, you know stringing some commands together in an attempt to get decent output from the blue-screen! If you are like me you will  wish you had a transcript of that Powershell session for prosperity or to just prove you did some work to the boss!

I could use it to cut and paste, as well we all know Grumpy Admin is lazy and would hate having to type stuff again. Or we can use it in our defence. “why did you do that horrible action which killed the production SharePoint server…” what action… you mean by actually installing it in the first place… as we all know installing SharePoint is a major cause of loss of productivity in an office!!!

So in order for you to save your bacon, and to cover you ass and to help you when you have mind farts on a Monday morning… I would like to introduce to you a neat little feature of Powershell –

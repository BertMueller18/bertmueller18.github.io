> Generating a CSR in MS Windows (using certreq)
On this page we'll explain how to generate a CSR (Certificate Signing Request) using certreq. The CSR will contain the public key and additional details for the certificate, especially the domain name (Common Name) and the contact details of the requestor. After the details in the CSR have been approved by the certificate authority, the certificate can be issued.

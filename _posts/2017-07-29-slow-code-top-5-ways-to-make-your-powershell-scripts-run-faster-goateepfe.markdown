## Slow Code: Top 5 Ways to Make Your PowerShell Scripts Run Faster
 
 Slow code?
Are you frustrated by slow PowerShell scripts? Is it impacting business processes? Need help tuning your scripts? Today's post is for you.

Can you identify with any of these customer slow PowerShell stories?

Case #1
Customer is scanning Active Directory Domain Controllers in multiple domains and forests scattered all over the state on slow links. This key audit data takes 62 hours to collect and impacts the business response to audit requests. After applying these techniques, the customer reports that the script now completes in 30 minutes.

Case #2
Customer needs to update user licensing on Office 365 for daily new user provisioning. This impacts the business due to 10 hour run time of the script. After applying these optimization tips, the script finishes in 14 minutes.

Case #3
Customer is parsing SCCM client log files that rotate every few minutes. But the script takes longer to run than the log refresh interval. After applying these techniques, the script is 10% of its original length and runs 10 times faster.

> Install and Configure BookStack Using Docker and LDAP
2017-06-09 DOCKERDOCSSYNOLOGY
BookStack

Documenting is quite a chore and since leaving Evernote, I’ve been searching for a good tool to help me structure my stuff. I did turn to blogging just keep the information handy but I can only publish cleansed articles. Which means I have quite a few unpublished articles that either contain secrets, are poorly structured and written or just half-finished.

Many have recommended to use BookStack to act like an internal wiki. I do run Confluence, I feel it is good but just not a perfect fit for my purposes. The basics of BookStack are really appealing since I come from a similar type of structure from ScreenSteps, with books and chapters. It does feel a bit rough around the edges but the basics are there and actively developed.

Since I just can’t write Markdown in any sensible way, I will still be using ClarifyIt or ScreenSteps for the actual authoring and then export the results via Markdown files. This is the same workflow I have for the blog using the static website framework Hexo. Next step is to tinker with a BookStack compatible Markdown template for ClarifyIt.

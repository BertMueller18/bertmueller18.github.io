> Azure S2S VPN with RRAS
 November 14, 2015  Michael Roger

For a while I have wanted to connect my home lab up to my Azure subscriptions via site-to-site Azure S2S VPN. There are a few blogs online on how to do this in ASM, although I wanted to do this with Azure Resource Manager.

My current setup is a Hyper-V host with a Windows Server 2012 R2 guest VM that is behind a router that is capable of IPsec passthrough. Officially Microsoft do not support this behind NAT, but this just for testing purposes, so donâ€™t use this in production environments!

Here are the steps that I used to connect my home network to ARM Azure S2S VPN.

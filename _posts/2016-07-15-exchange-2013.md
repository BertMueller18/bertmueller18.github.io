> Mail.que is growing larger in Exchange 2013
July 4, 2016 by Arunkumar Selvanathan Leave a Comment

Issue:

Mail.que is growing larger and occupying more disk space.

Cause:

This is by design and it is because of the new feature called Safetynet in Exchange 2013.

By default the safetynet hold time is 2 days, Exchange 2013 server holds 2 days mail in transport database and will purge those mails after 2 days. The mail.que file will not shrink because the space occupied by those purged mails will remain as whitespace.

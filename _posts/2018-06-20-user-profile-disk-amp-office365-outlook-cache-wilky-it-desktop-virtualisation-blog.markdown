> User Profile Disk & Office365 Outlook Cache
Background
Early February 2018, @james_kindon and myself began collaborating on a free and simple solution to avoid the requirement of storing Outlook OST files on network shares when deploying VDI or RDSH environments with Exchange Online. There are multiple solutions out there currently that address this issue, however not all organisations have access to these solutions and are left resorting to network share placement for OST files.

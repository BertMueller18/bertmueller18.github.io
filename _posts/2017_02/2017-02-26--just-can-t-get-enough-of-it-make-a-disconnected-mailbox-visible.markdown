> MAKE A DISCONNECTED MAILBOX VISIBLE
On January 11, 2017 Thomas Stensitzki 0Â Comment Exchange 2013 Exchange Server 163 Views
When you delete a mailbox or an Active Directory account, the soft-deleted or disconnected mailbox won't show up in the list of disconnected mailboxes immediately. The mailbox status is updated as part of a mailbox store maintenance task.

When you query a mailbox database for disconnected mailboxes you will find a mailbox having the DisconnectReason and DisconnectDate attribute empty.

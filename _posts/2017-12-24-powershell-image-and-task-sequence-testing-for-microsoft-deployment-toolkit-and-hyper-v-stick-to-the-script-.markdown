> POWERSHELL: IMAGE AND TASK SEQUENCE TESTING FOR MICROSOFT DEPLOYMENT TOOLKIT AND HYPER-V
Posted on 20 Dec 2017 by Mike Galvin
In a previous post I wrote about my Image Factory PowerShell script for MDT. This post is about a script derived from that which I setup to test my images and my deployment task sequences. Since this script is only an edit of the previous one I don’t intend to release it “officially” on the TechNet Gallery or the PowerShell Gallery.

To explain succinctly what this script does, it turns Task Sequences into Virtual Machines.

> Simple IOT Sunlight Sensing Raspberry Pi Project- SunIOT – Part 2
We just have added a new product, a Grove Sunlight Sensor to our lineup and wanted to build a project using it.   We are intending to add drivers for this sensing device to three of our product lines:  OurWeather, the GroveWeatherPi and the WXLink wireless data transmission products.  Since we are going to be using the Grove Sunlight Sensor so extensively, we thought we should build a quick example project.

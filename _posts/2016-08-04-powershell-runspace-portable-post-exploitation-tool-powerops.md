> PowerShell Runspace Portable Post Exploitation Tool 
aimed at making Penetration Testing with PowerShell “easier”

 

     PowerOPS is an application written in C# that does not rely on powershell.exe but runs PowerShell commands and functions within a powershell runspace environment (.NET). It intends to include multiple offensive PowerShell modules to make the process of Post Exploitation easier.

It tries to follow the KISS principle, being as simple as possible. The main goal is to make it easy to use PowerShell offensively and help to evade antivirus and other mitigations solutions. It does this by:

Doesn’t rely on powershell.exe, it calls PowerShell directly through the .NET framework, which might help bypassing security controls like GPO, SRP and App Locker.
The payloads are executed from memory and never touch disk, evading most antivirus engines.
PowerOPS was inspired by Cn33liz/p0wnedShell. Since PowerOPS offers basically an interactive PowerShell command prompt you are free to use the PowerShell tools included the way you want, and additionally execute any valid PowerShell command.

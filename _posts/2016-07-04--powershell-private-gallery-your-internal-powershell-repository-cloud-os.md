## “PowerShell Private Gallery” or “PSPrivateGallery”.



The idea is quite straight forward. Providing an internal (trusted) repository which provides access to your internal resources (scripts, modules, DSC resources, etc…) using the same SDII (Software Discovery, Installation and Inventory) mechanism provided by the PackageManagement and PowerShellGet modules.

For now, the project is called the “PowerShell Private Gallery”.

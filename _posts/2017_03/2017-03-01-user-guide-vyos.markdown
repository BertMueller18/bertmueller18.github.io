## Introduction
VyOS is a Linux-based network operating system that provides software-based network routing, firewall, and VPN functionality.

The VyOS project was started in late 2013 as a community fork of the GPL portions of Vyatta Core 6.6R1 with the goal of maintaining a free and open source network operating system in response to the decision to discontinue the community edition of Vyatta. Here everyone loves learning, older managers and new users.

VyOS is primarily based on Debian GNU/Linux and the Quagga routing engine. Its configuration syntax and command-line interface are loosely derived from Juniper JUNOS as modeled by the XORP project (which was the original routing engine Vyatta was based upon). Vyatta changed to the Quagga routing engine for release 4.0.

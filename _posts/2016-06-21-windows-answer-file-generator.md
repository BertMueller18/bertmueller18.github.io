> Windows Answer File Generator
Windows 7 can be installed without user intervention by placing a specially formatted XML file on a USB drive or floppy disk before booting from the installation DVD. The file's name is either Autounattend.xml (my preference) or Unattend.xml. The file is placed in the root directory of a USB drive or floppy disk.

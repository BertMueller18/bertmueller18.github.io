## How can I use Express Updates when patching Windows 10 with Quality Updates in System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch) ?

### Introduction
Windows 10 Enterprise first shipped in July 2015 with Windows 10 version 1507, and since then there have been 2 versions, Windows 10 version 1511 and Windows 10 version 1607. In spring of this year (2017) we will see another version of Windows 10 released (Creators Update), which will most likely be Windows 10 version 170x (the x is because I don't know what month it will release).
Â 
Every version of Windows 10 needs to be patched and those patches are released monthly, as each month goes by the patches are getting bigger and as a direct result, they are slower to transfer to the clients.

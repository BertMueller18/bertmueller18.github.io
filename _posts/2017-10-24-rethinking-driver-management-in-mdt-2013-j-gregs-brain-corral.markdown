> Rethinking Driver Management in MDT 2013
We have been using the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT) in LTI/Lite Touch mode here at the University for a long time now.  Why, we used it to deploy XP back when MDT still was called the Business Desktop Deployment Solution Accelerator (BDD).  In this time, we have gone though several different driver management methods.  Gone are the nightmare days of dealing with OEMSETUP files, $OEM$ directories, can elaborate “DriverPack” injection scripts for XP (thank goodness).

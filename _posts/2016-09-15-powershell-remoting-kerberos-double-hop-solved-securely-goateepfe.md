> The struggle is real.
Are you facing issues with PowerShell remoting and credentials? You remote into your jump box, but then any remoting beyond there gets a big red ACCESS DENIED. Maybe you’ve tried CredSSP, but people say that isn’t safe. Read today’s post for a completely legit, secure, safe, and easy way to enable Kerberos double hop for PowerShell remoting.

The Problem


It’s a tale as old as time:

ServerA talks to ServerB
ServerB talks to ServerC
Access denied!
You would have better luck asking a cheerleader to the prom. We call this the kerberos double hop. Yeah, it’s like a dance.

The struggle is real. Just check out this forum post on PowerShell.org from last month. After many years of PowerShell remoting we are still searching for a secure method of passing credentials to that elusive ServerC.

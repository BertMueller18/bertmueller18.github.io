## Search Group Policy with PowerShell Script

Posted on July 13, 2016 by Adam Fowler
I was looking for a certain Group Policy Preferences setting, where a registry value was being changed. Resultant Set Of Policy (RSOP) won’t help with these, and I couldn’t see a nice PowerShell command for searching through Group Policies.

I put the shoutout on Twitter to see who could help, and Tony Murray came back quickly with a script he’d created, and promptly uploaded to the Microsoft TechNet Gallery where I could download it.

It’s a reasonably simple script (which for me would have taken at least an hour to do beginning to end!) and is very easy to use.

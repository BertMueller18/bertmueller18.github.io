## Windows 10 Updates and Store GPO behavior with DualScan disabled and SCCM SUP/WSUS managed

Firstly...
Before you start reading this, you should be familiar with the DualScan Feature of Windows 10. Find more information on the following blog posts.

https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/wsus/2017/08/04/improving-dual-scan-on-1607/
https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/configurationmgr/2017/10/10/using-configmgr-with-windows-10-wufb-deferral-policies/
If you decided to disable DualScan (Do not allow update deferral policies to cause scan against Windows Update - Enabled) this post is for you.

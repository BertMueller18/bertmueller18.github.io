So you want to give iPads, iPhones, Android phones and other mobile devices and tablets that have Citrix Receiver access to your enterprise infrastructure securely. This can be done pretty easily using a Netscaler and the Access Gateway (aka CAG/Citrix Access Gateway, AGEE/Access Gateway Enterprise Edition) which is an SSL VPN among other things. First you need to prep your Citrix Web Interfaces.

 PowerShellDesired State Configuration Class Based Resource for Configuring Remote Desktop

MIKE F ROBBINS SEPTEMBER 29, 2016 0
Prior to PowerShell version 5 being released, I had written a PowerShell version 4 compatible DSC (Desired State Configuration) resource named cMrRDP for configuring Remote Desktop. It can be found in my DSC respository on GitHub. The recommendation at that point was to use the letter “c” as the prefix for community created DSC resources. The current recommendation is to no longer use the “c” prefix for DSC resources. Steven Murawski wrote a blog article titled “DSC People – Let’s Stop Using ‘c’ Now” that I recommend taking a look at.

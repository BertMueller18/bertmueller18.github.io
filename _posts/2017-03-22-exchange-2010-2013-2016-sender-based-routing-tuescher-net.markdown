## Exchange Sender Based Routing
A relatively simple solution based on a MS Knowledge Brief

You may have found this page while searching for Exchange 2010/2013/2016 sender based routing, because you need this feature.
I'm not a programmer, usually I just do some VB/KiX/Dos batch/PowerShell scripting needed for logon scripts, AD and Exchange, so I had to invest some time in this little piece of code which is my first real coding project including compiling, creating a dll and stuff. I'm still on a steep learning curve...
As it is now it works as I want and it's externally configurable. I'd like to share it with you As Is, no guarantees whatsoever. Code is not *that* bad, a trained programmer would to many things different, there is no error checking for wrong input from the config files for example. So it's not foolproof, but as long as you know what you are doing... :-)
If you like it, use it, enhance it, found a logic flaw or bug in the code or just want to give me some advice what I could improve, I would be glad to hear from you at Contact.

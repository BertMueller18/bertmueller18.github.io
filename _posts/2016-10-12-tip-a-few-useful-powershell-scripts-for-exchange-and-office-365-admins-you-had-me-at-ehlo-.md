## Tip: a few useful PowerShell scripts for Exchange and Office 365 Admins

Recently there has been some helpful activity over on the Microsoft Script Center for Exchange and Office 365 administrators. Here are 3 scripts that we wanted to call out, as well as a bit of an overview of what they do:

Install Exchange 2016 Pre-requisites.ps1 – makes it easier to install Exchange 2016 prerequisites
O365_Installs_Connections.ps1 – makes it easier to prepare machines from which you administer Office 365
O365_Logon Module – an easier way to log into Office 365 services using PowerShell
Please see specific script downloads for support options and more details.

> GlusterFS

Tim Schürmann
GlusterFS combines the unused storage space on multiple servers to create a single, large, virtual drive that you can mount like a legacy filesystem – using NFS or FUSE on a client PC. And, you can add more servers or remove existing servers from the storage pool on the fly. GlusterFS works kind of like “RAID on the network,” and if you look closely, you will discover many RAID concepts during setup.

GlusterFS really comes into its own when you need to store huge quantities of data, have redundant file storage, or write data very quickly for later access. GlusterFS can juggle multiple petabytes easily, and it’s easy to install and manage.

## Tutorial: The NetScaler, Storefront, Receiver, SSO headache29 Jul
So this is one of those topics why I actually started this blog. Iâ€™m preparing our environment for a big upgrade off all Citrix Receivers, implement Storefront and decommission our last two webinterface servers. A nice job which already gave me quite a headache. So in this tut I will try to give you the complete tutorial how to implement NSGW with Storefront so the Receiver can actually SSO, and all traffic is routed through the NetScaler Gateway.

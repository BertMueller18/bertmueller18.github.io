> Why adding WinSAT formal to your task sequence can be a shiny thing to do

It has certainly been a good twitter-week with many interesting announcements and discussions (if you’re not on twitter, get on twitter). One discussion that stood out was a question about running WinSAT formal being needed for Windows 10 Deployments.

Cred: Thanks to Steven Kister (@StevenKister1) for providing excellent research on the topic.

 

Background info

WinSAT has been around since Windows Vista to help do performance benchmark of the PC, as well as optimize the system. As a good example, WinSAT will detect if you are using a SSD drive, and for example disable Prefetch if it finds a SSD, along with a few other things. Shorthand: Without the optimizations from WinSAT a PC may not give you the best performance.

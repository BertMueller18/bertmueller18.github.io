> A Practical Guide to GitHub for the PowerShell Scripter
When I first started dipping my fingers into the GitHub pool, it was because I really felt there was a need.  Version control was becoming an issue and having to re-write code I’d already perfected because of a glitch somewhere on the way–translation: accidentally deleting the wrong file–was something that just had to be addressed.  And, I think like a lot of PowerShell scripters, I soon started asking questions like:  WTF is this?  What is going on?  Who came up with this crap?  I’m no expert, but read on if you’re interested in learning how to use PowerShell and GitHub together.

> Removing the spaces in your file name using PowerShell
15th September 2016PeterLeave a comment
I was recently working on some import-csv commands and scripts that required data from multiple sources.  As I have no control over how other people name their files (some uses spaces) I needed to ensure that the file names in certain folders have no spaces.  Its nicer to have files with no spaces in the name.  I’m old fashioned.

> Introducing the Invoke-Wsus PowerShell function
A couple of weeks ago I wrote a blog post on WSUS management with PowerShell. The post came with a script that could be used to manage automatic approvals of WSUS patches and updates.

This time I have decided to transform that script in an advanced PowerShellÂ function named Invoke-WSUS (you can find it on my Github).

This function is kind of jack-of-all-trade: depending on the used parameter set, it can do a series of actions, as shown in the description and in the help file.

In previous Part 1 of this series I introduced you to Ceph, the open-source scale-out object storage. In this Part 2, I’m going to explain you the architecture of Ceph. It took me a while to fully understand how Ceph is built, and what all its components are and what is their functions; as such, I’ll try to give you a really simple explanation, so you will not have to spent so much time as I did, even if its principles are really simple.

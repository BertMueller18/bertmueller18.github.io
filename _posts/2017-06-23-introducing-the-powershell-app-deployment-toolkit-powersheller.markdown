Myself and my good friend Dan Cunningham have been working on an exciting PowerShell project together. Here’s a bit of the blurb:

The PowerShell App Deployment Toolkit provides a set of functions to perform common application deployment tasks and to interact with the user during a deployment. It simplifies the complex scripting challenges of deploying applications in the enterprise, provides a consistent deployment experience and improves installation success rates.

The PowerShell App Deployment Toolkit can be used to replace your WiseScript, VBScript and Batch wrapper scripts with one versatile, re-usable and extensible tool.

For more information and to download the toolkit, visit http://psappdeploytoolkit.com

Here are a few screenshots of the user interface:

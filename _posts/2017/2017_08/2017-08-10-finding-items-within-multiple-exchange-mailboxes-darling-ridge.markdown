## Finding Items within Multiple Exchange Mailboxes
The Exchange Problem

The need for finding items within multiple exchange mailboxes started last week when I was presented with an interesting predicament. One of the staff members from another division in the Forsythes group was receiving calendar invites for a meeting that was no longer valid.  What was worse, the user sending them no longer worked at the company. Many system engineers would look at this problem and say “Aha! I’ know what to do”. They would then go onto talk about re-enabling the account and logging in as the user and removing the entries. The interesting predicament part was the user no longer exists in Active Directory nor does their mailbox exist!

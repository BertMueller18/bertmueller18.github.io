## PowerShell: Optimization and Performance Testing

### Overview

 PowerShell has been around long enough now that many of the basic questions are well-addressed. Between Get-Help, the internet and all the community resources available to scripters most of the what and how required to accomplish ordinary tasks can be answered quickly. Once you get your script working, bug-free, and, ready for roll out to production another set of questions may arise for which there is not as much discussion yet: how do I write the best possible script? Transforming a working script into a highly efficient, robust tool, however, requires a different set of questions and thought processes. This begins to bring the scripter out of the world of end use and administration into the arena of the developer. While some are reluctant to pick up another hat and put it in the development ring there is really no better tool than PowerShell to open the door into this parallel universe. So, let's take a glance at some basic concepts for maximizing a script's capabilities and then move onto some more in depth questions to see just how far we can push the envelope.

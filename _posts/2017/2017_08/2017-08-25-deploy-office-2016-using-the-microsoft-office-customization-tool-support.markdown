> Deploy Office 2016 Using The Microsoft Office Customization Tool
Created January 06, 2016 02:24 by Brigg Angus,  Updated Tuesday at 20:07
Purpose:
You wish to deploy Office 2016 using the Microsoft Office Customization Tool (OCT) and PDQ Deploy to n machines within your organization.

Notes:

While this deployment is for 32-bit Office 2016 ProPlus, the steps can be easily modified for any Office 2016 product using the OCT for either x86 or x64 deployments.
This deployment is not meant for any Office 365 or Click-to-run product. For help deploying Office 365, see our Office 365 Deployment Guide.
These instructions are supplied for guidance only. The results have been tested on multiple machines, but every environment is different and the ability to cover all situations is not possible. It is recommended the instructions in this knowledgebase be thoroughly tested in a lab environment prior to deployment in a production environment.

## Display Windows 10 notifications with PowerShell

In this post I won't talk about a tool or script I created but about a cool way to display notifications on your computer using PowerShell.
Last month  Stephen Owen wrote a great post about a module called BurnToast.. 
I have already heard about it but never tested. 
How wrong I was, this module is just amazing. 
That's why I decided to write my own post about it.

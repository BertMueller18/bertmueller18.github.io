This post goes wider than regular ConfigMgr stuff and is about adding logging to all your scripts.

Intro

As a ConfigMgr admin Iâ€™ve always been blessed to be working with a system that has extensive logging capabilities. A lot of my knowledge and troubleshooting skills, as a result, come from reading logfiles.

A while back, after writing yet another script, that could use decent logging. I set forward to find an easy way to add logging from the start of writing a new script. After some investigation I found a very popular logging framework from the .Net community called Log4Net https://logging.apache.org/log4net/index.html

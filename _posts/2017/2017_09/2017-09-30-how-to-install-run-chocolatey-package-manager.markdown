> Converting Windows to LINUX - Chocolatey Package Manager
July 14, 2017 in #homelab #windows2linux
Attempt at Defeating Microsoft

About six or so months ago, I decided to take a shot at running Linux full time. I knew the transition was going to be difficult. The first hurdle was to decide which OS to go with. There are so many distros out there that it can be a bit intimidating to decide which one will be your daily driver. At the urging of one of my best friends and co-workers I ultimately went with Arch Linux. Overall the experience was tremendous. I wound up installing pacaur to compile and install packages from the Arch Linux User Repository. This was a great system, unrivaled by many distros out there. The AUR is a giant repository of Arch packages that the community maintains and contributes to. After making packages easy to install for just about anything and everything I ran into one final roadblock: Games. I'm a gamer and there aren't many games that are developed with Linux support in mind. Long story short, this was eventually the reason why I had to migrate everything back to Windows. I tried to use hardware passthrough via KVM and run Windows in a VM. At the time the driver support for Nvidia GPUs didn't cooperate with Windows running in a VM environment. I walked away from the project frustrated and defeated.

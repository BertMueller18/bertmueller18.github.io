## PowerShell module: Compare 2 computer configurations (services, drivers...)

 Damien Van Robaeys   12:49 
 

In this post, I will show you a module I created that allows you to compare two computer configurations.
In my previous post I showed you a module that allows you to export your computer configuration (Services, Drivers, Software, Process, BIOS settings) in multiple format (CSV, XML, HTML).
Using the compare module you can now compare two computer computer configurations by comparing those export.Â 
You can compare drivers, services, software and process by choosing CSV or XML exports. The comparison export can be done in HTML or XLSX formats.

Ever dreamed about some mission control like dashboards to get a quick insight about the performance of your Windows systems? 

If yes, then you probably like a view like this:

So here is how you get such a dashboard for your system in 6 simple steps in under an hour:

Install a VM with Ubuntu Linux 16.04.2 LTS

Even when it is Linux, no rocket science is needed here . Just download the ISO image from the Ubuntu Website, attach it to your VM and boot form it. After that you get asked some simple questions about time zone, keyboard and partition settings. The most you can accept with the defaults or choose simple your preferred languages etc. Quite easy.

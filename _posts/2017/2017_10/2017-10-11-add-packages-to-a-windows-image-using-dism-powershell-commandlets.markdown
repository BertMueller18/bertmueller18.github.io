> Add packages to a Windows Image using DISM PowerShell commandlets
Stop using DISM.exe, use PowerShell DISM commandlets instead…
Last week, I was working on a post on how to get a updated Windows 7 image using SCCM Offline Servicing and DISM. I spent a few hours making and testing a batch file, writing the post and simplifying the language. I was about to press “Publish” when my idiotic brain began to wonder why I’m posting a batch file in 2017. I could not let it go, so I am publishing this post instead. The windows 7 update saga will follow later this week :)

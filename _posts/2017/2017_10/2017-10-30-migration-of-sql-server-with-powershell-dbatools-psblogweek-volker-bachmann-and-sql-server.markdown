It is also part of my blog series about migrating our physical SQL Server to a VMware Environment. For now, all of these articles are in German only – sorry. The first three articles describe the basic server configuration, installation, and VM guest configuration of the VMware Environment. This article describes the migration itself.
I’ll write a recap of the whole series in English later on.

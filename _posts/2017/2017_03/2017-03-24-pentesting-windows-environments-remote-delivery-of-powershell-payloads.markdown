> Pentesting Windows environments: remote delivery of PowerShell payloads
Dec 25, 2016

PowerShell is an amazing post-exploitation tool available to the attacker during engagements in Windows environments. Tools like PowerSploit or PowerShell Empire help out a lot during internal test. Problem is, restrictive execution policy is enabled by default on windows machines which makes it problematic to run ps1 scripts. Not having admin rights on the target machine means you basically confine yourself to executing PowerShell one-liners which have length restrictions (cmd.exe has a limit of 8191 characters).

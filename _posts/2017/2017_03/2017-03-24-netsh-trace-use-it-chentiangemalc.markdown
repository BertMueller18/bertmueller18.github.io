> Netsh Trace–Use It!
Posted on February 22, 2012 by chentiangemalc
One of the great advantages of Windows 7/2008 R2 is the built in network tracing capability. (I think this was included in Vista/Server 2008 but that memory has been erased from my mind)

NetSh itself has now become a vastly powerful command line tool – I highly recommend anyone providing support on Windows systems to examine all the options available here.

In the past if you wanted to do network packet tracing you needed to install a tool on end user’s machine such as WireShark or Microsoft Network Monitor. With Windows 7 that is no longer necessary.

> Configuring an HTTPS Pull Server for Desired State Configuration PowerShell Version 5
Applies to: Windows PowerShell 5.0

Secondly, you now use a registration key to connect to the pull server instead of a configuration ID. A third difference is you can now call out which configurations a node should request from the pull server by name. You no longer have to rename the .mof documents on the pull server with the GUI used for the configuration ID. Keep in mind that both methods still work, however the new method does make combining

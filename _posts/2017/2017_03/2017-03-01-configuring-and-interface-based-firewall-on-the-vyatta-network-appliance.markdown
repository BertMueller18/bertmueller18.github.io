> Configuring and interface-based firewall on the Vyatta network appliance
Last updated on: 2015-04-16 Authored by: Sameer Satyam
You can use a network appliance as a firewall to protect Rackspace Cloud Server instances.

This article describes how to configure interface-based firewalls on a Vyatta appliance and apply them on the public interface for local traffic (terminating on the Vyatta appliance) and for ingress traffic (traversing the appliance and destined for Cloud Servers).

For a comprehensive guide to configuring the Vyatta appliance as a firewall, see the Vyatta Firewall Reference Guide.

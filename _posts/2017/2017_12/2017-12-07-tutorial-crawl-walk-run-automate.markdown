> Deploy an Office Online Server Environment using PowerShell DSC
 2017-12-01 Nik Charlebois	 Tutorial  22 Leave a comment
In this article we will cover the process of automating the configuration of an Office Online Server 2016 (OOS) using PowerShell Desired State Configuration. The end result will be a fully working OOS environment that has the French Language Pack installed on. Language pack support is something new I recently added to the OfficeOnlineServerDSC module and which will be available starting with version 1.1.0.0 scheduled to be released on December 20th of 2017.

Shared mailboxes in Exchange Server and Exchange Online are a great way for a team of your users to share the workload of reading and responding to emails. Shared mailboxes are often used in customer service scenarios, whether that be internal customer service (such as Payroll or Human Resources matters), or external customer service (such as providing service and support to buyers of your products).

Although shared mailboxes provide a basic, single point of contact for customer service, they're not well suited to any situation that requires one of more of the following:

tracking of individual cases (e.g. by assigning ticket numbers)
tracking against SLAs or response targets (e.g. time to answer, time to close)
task assignments (e.g. to avoid duplicating effort, or to assign to specialists)
easy access to historical correspondence (e.g. looking up previous support requests from a customer)
communications between support team members (e.g. adding notes for others to understand the context of a ticket)
integration with knowledge bases (e.g. keywords in customer requests surfacing existing KB information)
workflows and business rules (e.g. routing requests through multi-stage processes for resolution)
any type of reporting (e.g. number of tickets received vs closed per day/week/month)
mobile access (a long-standing pain point for Exchange shared mailboxes)

> Deploying an Enterprise Root Certificate Authority

Setting up an Enterprise Root Certificate Authority isn’t a task that you’ll complete on a regular basis and something I think I’ve done twice, maybe 3 times, ever. Each time I forget what I did previously and you can guarantee I’m using a different version of Windows Server each time. Please note as you read these article and the next, that whilst I have an interest in PKI, I don’t consider myself an expert. Deploying a PKI is not a simple task, so read up carefully if you’ve not done this before.

> ASCII GUI in your PowerShell Console
I stumbled upon this epic .net project by PhonicUK on Github for “an event-driven windowing system using a line-art interface for use by command-line applications” and thought I would see if it worked in PowerShell. The results, I think are pretty cool!

The code to create this is really very similar to WinForms style of coding and can be generated very quickly. I will give a short walkthrough on how to create a GUI using this sweet library.

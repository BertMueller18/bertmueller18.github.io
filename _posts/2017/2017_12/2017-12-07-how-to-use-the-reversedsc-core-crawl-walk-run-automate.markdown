## How to use the ReverseDSC Core
 2017-01-13  Nik Charlebois	 Tutorial  248 Leave a comment
The ReverseDSC.Core module is the heart of the ReverseDSC process. This module defines several functions that will help you dynamically extract the DSC configuration script for each resource within a DSC module. The ReverseDSC Core is generic, meaning that it applies to any technology, not only SharePoint. In this blog article I will describe in details how you can start using the ReverseDSC Core module today and integrate it into your existing solutions. To better illustrate the process, I will be using an example where I will be extracting the properties of a given user within Active Directory using the ReverseDSC Core.

# Copy databases from 5 different SQL Servers in 100 seconds with the DBATools PowerShell Module

MIKE F ROBBINS JULY 14, 2017 1
As referenced in my blog article from yesterday, I’ll be presenting a PowerShell 101 session at SQL Saturday Atlanta tomorrow morning (July 15, 2017). While I plan to cover the basics of PowerShell, I also plan to show you what you can do with PowerShell without having to write very much code at all.

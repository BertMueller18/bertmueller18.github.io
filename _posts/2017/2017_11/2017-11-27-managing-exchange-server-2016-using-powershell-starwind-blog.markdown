PowerShell has become the preferred tool for managing Microsoft server products. Sysadmins can take full advantage of PowerShell to manage roles and perform routine management tasks. By using the command line, sysadmins are able to:

Create a mailbox
Configure a receive connector
Generate a custom report
Manage Distribution Group members, permissions, and group types
Manage Exchange Services
Etc.

In this article, we will not cover all the Exchange Management cmdlets but I will describe several examples to guide you in the right direction. In all Exchange Server edition, aÂ lot of settings are configured automatically by the Exchange installation. So it is a good idea to explore all the settings individually to become familiar with your Exchange Server.

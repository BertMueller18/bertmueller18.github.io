Script to install or update drivers directly from Microsoft Catalog
17 FEBRUARY 2017
Windows10 does automatically install missing Drivers from the Microsoft Update Catalog after the OS Setup. All the Drivers are also available through Windows Update if you connect directly to Microsoft...But you will not get any Drivers if you are using ConfigMgr/WSUS as the driver category is not synced.

So what can you do if you are using WSUS but still want to get the Drives from Microsoft?

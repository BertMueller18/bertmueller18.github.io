> Consistent $Profile across All PowerShell Hosts and a Backup on GitHub
      1 Vote

Hello Friends,

I work or on multiple PowerShell editors and multiple computers (Home and Office) and I heavily rely on my PowerShell Profile for stuff like API Keys, Environment variables, useful Functions and Aliases.

Switching to a new machine or a different Editor, I find myself help less ( Not this much like it sounds here  ) . Since I keep on adding Functions to my $Profile but its not there on other editors until I copy-paste the profile, moreover  all newly added Functions are absent from on a different computer.

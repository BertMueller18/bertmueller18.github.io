## Exchange Client Network Bandwidth Calculator
Jun 16 2016, Written by Kurt Jung

The Exchange Client Network Bandwidth Calculator helps Exchange engineers and architects to calculate bandwidth requirements for their specific set of clients when planning an Exchange Server deployment. It has been some time since Microsoft released an updated version of the Exchange Client Network Bandwidth Calculator but it is still a useful tool for mitigating the risks involved in Exchange Server network bandwidth planning. The latest public version of the calculator is available at TechNet. This tool is designed for both on premise Exchange customers and Office 365 users.
Before we start using the Exchange Client Network Bandwidth Calculator, we should ensure we have certain data to hand, which we will need to input into two categories â€“ organization and user:

Organization data includes fields such as working hours per day, mobile device days to sync and offline address book size.
User Profile data is customizable depending on your business. It includes fields such as average message size, messages sent per mailbox per day, average mailbox size and average meetings per mailbox per day.

> Learning PowerShell as a DBA: Debugging PowerShell - It's easier than you think

Apr 23, 09:36 AM

I was going to dive into a little less meaty topics to start my PowerShell series but I have had a couple requests for debugging pop up, and so that’s where our journey begins.

It’s a little backwards, but I hope you learn a bit about Set-PsBreakpoint and how to ask the shell a few more questions about what the heck it is doing.

Debugging often comes up when you get beyond the super trivial questions and start asking “what is this magical thing doing for me?”

I wanted to include a few terms that may be familiar or may not be (and that’s ok!), but they are good to know when approaching a debugger.

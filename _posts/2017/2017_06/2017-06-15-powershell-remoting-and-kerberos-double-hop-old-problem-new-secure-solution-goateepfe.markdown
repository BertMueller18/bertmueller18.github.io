 PowerShell and DevOps Global Summit 2017
This week I enjoyed presenting at the PowerShell and DevOps Global Summit 2017. If you have not attended, I highly encourage it. You will get to meet PowerShell team members from Microsoft, MVPs, and the people you follow on Twitter! Follow @PshSummit on Twitter to get the alerts for registration. I even work for Microsoft, and I learn a ton every year from the amazing sessions. It is also great connecting with everyone in the PowerShell community.

See this previous blog post for the benefits of resource-based Kerberos constrained delegation and how it can apply to PowerShell remoting. It is not a complete solution, but it works for the key scenarios described below and a few others. The article also outlines a number of other possible Kerberos double hop solutions. The PowerShell documentation team took that article, tweaked it, and turned it into a documentation page here.

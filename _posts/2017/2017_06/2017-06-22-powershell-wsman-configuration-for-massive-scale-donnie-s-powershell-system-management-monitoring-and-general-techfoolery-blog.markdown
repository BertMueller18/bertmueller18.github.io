## POWERSHELL WSMAN CONFIGURATION FOR MASSIVE SCALE
JUNE 19, 2017 DONNIE_TAYLOR@OUTLOOK.COM	LEAVE A COMMENT
In my day job, I constantly strive to push PowerShell to the limit, attempting to use absolutely every bit of processor/memory/network bandwidth available. One way I do this is with PoshRSJob written by Boe Prox. PoshRSJob is a wonder multi-threading tool, and I use it at pretty heavy scale â€“ typically at a 100 thread throttle.

## Deploy Applications in Enterprise like a PRO
Hello, my name is Tomasz Gościmiński and I’m an Infrastructure Consultant at Predica. Today’s post is about the value of deployment tandem called System Center Configuration Manager and his smaller companion PowerShell App Deployment Toolkit. When both are integrated in your environment great things can happen – so let’s start…

Business Problem: Recently, Contoso experienced a number of system outages in which the Company’s core business applications shut down unexpectedly. After several days of investigation, John Snow, Contoso Infrastructure administrator, discovered that the outages were the result of a number of vulnerabilities in Enterprise Line of Business applications and users Software. Since then, it is critical for Contoso to manage lifecycle of applications:

initial creation and testing of application deployment;
updating the deployed application to a newer version;
update and removal of the application from computers on the production network.
To reduce unplanned downtime in the future, Contoso must find a way to ensure being always up to date and manage lifecycle of applications in a controlled manner.

So you have an Arduino that you love playing with. You also have one of your favorite code editors, VS Code. Every time you start coding with one or the other, you wish you could use both together.

Now you can! (And feel great about it since the extension is open source!)

Visual Studio Code Extension for Arduino is now open sourced!
We are glad to share the news that the Visual Studio Code Extension for Arduino has been open sourced on GitHub.com at https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-arduino! This is a great team effort to provide a good development experience for Arduino developers.

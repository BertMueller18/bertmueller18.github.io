> Securing Domain Controllers to Improve Active Directory Security
ActiveDirectorySecurity, Microsoft Security, Technical Reference by Sean Metcalf
Active Directory security effectively begins with ensuring Domain Controllers (DCs) are configured securely. At BlackHat USA this past Summer, I spoke about AD for the security professional and provided tips on how to best secure Active Directory. This post focuses on Domain Controller security with some cross-over into Active Directory security. The blog is called ADSecurity after all… 
This post covers some of the best methods to secure Active Directory by securing Domain Controllers in the following sections:
Default Domain & Domain Controller Policies
Creating Domain & Domain Controller Security Baseline GPOs
Patching Domain Controllers
Protecting Domain Controllers
Domain Controller Recommended Group Policy Settings
Configuring Domain Controller Auditing (Event Logs)
Domain Controller Events to Monitor (Event Logs)
Key Domain Controller Security Items
As with any major change to infrastructure, please test before deploying changes.

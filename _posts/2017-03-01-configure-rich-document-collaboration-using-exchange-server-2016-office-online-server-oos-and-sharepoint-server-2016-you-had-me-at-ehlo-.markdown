## Configure rich document collaboration using Exchange Server 2016, Office Online Server (OOS) and SharePoint Server 2016


This post explains the configuration steps needed to get rich document collaboration working between Exchange Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2016, and Office Online Server, in your On-Premises environment.

Introduction
When used together, Exchange Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2016, and Office Online Server provide a rich set of document collaboration features.

For example, rather than directly attaching a document to an e-mail message you may now send a link to the document stored in OneDrive for Business (ODB). Outlook and Outlook on the Web (new name for OWA) will still display the file as if it was directly attached to the message like a classic attachment would be, as well as allow people to work with the file like they would with a classic attachment. Additionally, many people will be able to read and edit the same file at the same time while it is stored in OneDrive for Business (ODB).

You can see a short demo of how this collaboration can look like right here.

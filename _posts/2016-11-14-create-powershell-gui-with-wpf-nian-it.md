> Create Powershell GUI with WPF
2016-11-06 by Niclas Andersson
Creating a simple GUI

I recently switched to WPF to create graphical interfaces for my tools.
In this post I will show you a very simple way of creating the GUI using Visual Studio.

Previously I was using WinForms and creating everything manually and eventually I got tired of this since it took alot of time.
I’ve also tried to use Powershell Studio but since that is a product that is not free of charge and WinForms is getting old I felt like this was a good transition.
The switch to WPF really sped things up for me and made my tools look really fresh and modern.

The GUI that I will build here will look like this.

It is very simple and ugly but it will be enough for this post. 
It will run a function when you click “Get Info” and display your Windows product name in the textbox.
The button Close will only close the window.

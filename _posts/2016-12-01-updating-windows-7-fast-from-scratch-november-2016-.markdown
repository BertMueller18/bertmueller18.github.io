> Updating Windows 7 Fast From Scratch [November 2016]
Here's how to build a Windows 7 image quickly and cleanly. If you're using a VM, remember to boost it to 8 cores and 4GB of RAM.

This was tested and proven on a Hyper-V VM as of 2016-10-26.

NOTE: The "for enterprise images" section is only for large businesses who want to run the same customized baseline configuration we do,Â otherwise it can be safely ignored.

> One-Time-Passwords using oathtool on Ubuntu 14.04(+)
Posted on January 15, 2015
So I’ve finally found the motivation and the time to set up OTP for my ssh logins!

DISCLAIMER: Let me say upfront that there are plenty of articles on using Google’s GAuthenticator which I didn’t want to use. Since the whole PRISM thing was leaked I try to decentralise my data as much as possible and distrust big names more since they are surely a more attractive target than the small players.

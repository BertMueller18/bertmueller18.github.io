## Configure Trigger-Start Services with Service Trigger Editor

Improve performance on Windows 10/8/7 & Windows Server 2016/2012/2008 R2 by starting (or stopping) your Windows Services on demand

Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 introduced some cool new features for Windows Services. One of the most important, called Service Triggers, enables Windows Services to be started or stopped when certain conditions are met instead of having to run 24x7. Service Trigger Editor was created to manage this new feature and easily add/edit/view Service Triggers.

## Calendar Sharing across Devices w/ Exchange or EXO/O365

Starting in Exchange 2010 you have been able to share your calendar, if enabled at the organization level, with anyone on the Internet anonymously. This can still be done today with Exchange 2016 and Office 365 in the ICS (iCAL), which can be used by most email\calendar clients, and HTML formats.

Personally, I use this support so I can view my wife and two teenager’s calendars and they can view my personal and work calendar. From a professional standpoint, this would be great for a manager to view his team member’s calendars or an admin assist to be able to view their manager’s calendar, from their mobile devices. The ActiveSync protocol, used by most mobile devices, does not support delegated mailbox or calendar access. So access team member or other people’s calendars from mobile devices has to be setup manually.

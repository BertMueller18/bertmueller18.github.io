> How To Implement Dynamic Parameters in Your PowerShell Functions
Choosing the correct input for your functions will save time and energy in the long run.

By Adam Bertram10/06/2016
Allowing for the right kind of input into PowerShell functions is important. It can mean the difference between writing a function once and forgetting about it constantly having to refactor it to account for situations that you never thought of. Taking a step back before building that function and clearly defining what parameters should be added is an important part of function design.

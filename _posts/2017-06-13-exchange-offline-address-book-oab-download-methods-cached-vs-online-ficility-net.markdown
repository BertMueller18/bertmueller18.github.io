Theory

By default OAB is a point in time snapshot of global address list and it is used as cached source of information about Exchange recipients properties. OAB is stored on Exchange servers (see my previous article https://ficility.net/2013/03/04/oab-differences-between-exchange-2010-and-exchange-2013-in-brief/) and downloaded to client once Outlook is configured in Cached mode. I would like to test modes of using address book,
while Outlook is in cached mode. There are several methods to download OAB. These methods depends on registry settings of Outlook (full article here:http://support.microsoft.com/kb/823580)

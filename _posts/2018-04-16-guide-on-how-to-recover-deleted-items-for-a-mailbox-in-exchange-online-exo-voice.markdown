A comprehensive guide on how to recover Deleted Items for a mailbox in Exchange Online

 This guide is intended to help both Exchange administrators and regular users that are comfortable using some advanced troubleshooting techniques in order to restore mailbox content.

IMPORTANT: Please note though that if the emails were deleted more than 30 days ago, they cannot be recovered anymore. Also, if you fail to find the items by using this guide, then the emails have been purged and Microsoft Support cannot recover them as well.

In Outlook, click on deleted items folder, then look in the Outlook toolbar you will have the following tabs: File, Home, Send/Receive, Folder, View and Search.
While deleted items is selected, press on the Folder tab and locate in the menu "Recover Deleted Items" and click on it.

> dbachecks implementation (part 1)
This post will detail the SQL database/infrastructure tests we have configured on our data warehouse environment using dbachecks, the open source PowerShell module.

I will just say I think dbachecks is awesome.  I’m pretty grounded and not known to hype things up but if anybody is questioning if they should be using the module I would strongly encourage them to do so.  There is a bit of a learning curve if you aren’t used to PowerShell but it’s totally worth the effort and it is possible to be so much more proactive in terms of checking some of the basic things that can go wrong.

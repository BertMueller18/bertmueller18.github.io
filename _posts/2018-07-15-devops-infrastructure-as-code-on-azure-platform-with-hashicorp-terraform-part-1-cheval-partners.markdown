> DEVOPS – INFRASTRUCTURE AS CODE ON AZURE PLATFORM WITH HASHICORP TERRAFORM PART 1
Posted On 27 Mar 2016 By chevaladmin In ARM, Automation, Azure, DevOps, Hashicorp
At Cheval Partners, we believe that infrastructure as code is essential to get most out of your cloud platforms. Infrastructure as code is also required to implement immutable infrastructure. Hashicorp has a suite of products that make it easy to implement infrastructure as code on numerous public and private cloud platforms. We have been leveraging Hashicorp tools for the past year for AWS implementations. We have many clients that are deploying applications on Azure Platform. We were unable to use Hashicorp tools with Azure because Azure Resource Manager support was missing. We were ecstatic to read this announcement from Hashicorp that Packer and Terraform now support Azure Resource manager. https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/azure-packer-terraform.html I will use this blog post to introduce you to using Terraform to provision Azure Resource Manager resources.

> Microsoft Azure Germany launch – Azure Resource Manager deployments with Azure Cli in Microsoft Azure Germany

Let’s get started with Azure Resource Manager (ARM) deployments in Microsoft Azure Germany

Today, Microsoft Azure Germany was announced officially, so it is time for some technical details how to deploy your workloads using Azure Resource Manager (ARM). Generally your existing ARM templates will work in the German Cloud as long as the services you need are available yet and the ARM resource provider does exist. I will show you that with little to no changes to your existing ARM templates you will be able to use the German Azure locations to deploy your workloads.

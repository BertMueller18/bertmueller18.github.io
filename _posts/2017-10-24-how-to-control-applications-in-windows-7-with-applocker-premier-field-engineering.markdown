For my follow up article to How to use Windows 7 to lock down removable media and keep your computer safe, I would like to discuss another feature within Windows 7 Enterprise and Ultimate editions that both individuals and enterprises can take advantage of – AppLocker.
AppLocker is a new feature built within Windows 7 that allows an organization or individual to whitelist applications on their workstation. In the past, Windows had made use of “Software Restriction Policies” that were there to blacklist applications, however with AppLocker we have the ability to do either task – whitelist or blacklist an application. Software Restriction Policies were easy to implement, but operationally it was a difficult task to maintain.

## Walkthrough: Upgrading to Windows 10 1703 (Creators Update) with Microsoft Deployment Toolkit
Posted by MIKE GALVIN on 27 JUL 2017
If you’re looking to deploy the latest version of Windows 10 1703 (better known as the Creators Update) as a fresh install, please check out this post. This post is designed to walk through installing and configuring Microsoft Deployment Toolkit and to create a Task Sequence to upgrade to Windows 10 1703 from a previous version of Windows.

The Windows upgrade process has come along way in recent years, so in certain circumstances it may be worth while running an upgrade, rather than a wipe-and-load. Additionally with Windows 10’s frequent updates being the case now, rather than doing upgrades via WSUS which may not be preferable depending on your environment, it may be better to do upgrades in a more controlled way.

If you have installed an enterprise or standalone certification authority (CA) that uses a Cryptographic Service Provider (CSP) for its private key, you might want migrate that key to a software Key Storage Provider (KSP). For example, this migration would then let the CA support the latest enhanced key storage mechanism and stronger key and signature algorithms for Cryptography Next Generation (CNG).

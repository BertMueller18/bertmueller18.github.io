> How to automate VMWare VM creation using powercli oscustomizationspec
Salutations!

I have been doing a lot of VMware PowerCLI automation this last year and a half. Up Until my recent projects, I have done mostly only HyperV / SCVMM automation (For Virtual Machine Deployments). For OS deployments I mainly used ConfigMgr (SCCM). Today, I would like to go through some powercli oscustomizationspec automation.

I’ll go through in a few posts on some interesting topics on the things I have learned using VMWare and PowerCLI. Things that I either not found in the documentation, or, simply, that I think are worth mentioning because they didn’t seem that obvious to me when I started first with PowerCLI.

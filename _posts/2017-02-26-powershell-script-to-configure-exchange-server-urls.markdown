> PowerShell Script to Configure Exchange Server Client Access URLs
AUGUST 27, 2015 Â  BY PAUL CUNNINGHAM
ConfigureExchangeURLs.ps1 is a PowerShell script to make it quick and easy to configure the Client Access namespaces on your Exchange servers. The script is designed to apply the same namespace to all Client Access services on the server. You can specify different internal and external URLs. If you have a more complex namespace configuration to apply (for example separate namespaces for each service) then this script does not cater to your scenario, however you can probably adapt it your particular needs.

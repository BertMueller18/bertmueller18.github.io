There are over 700 PowerShell cmdlets to help you automate routine and complex tasks in Windows Azure. Here's how you can start taking advantage of what PowerShell has to offer in Azure.



The cloud is a huge topic these days. It seems like every time you look around, one of the big tech companies is talking cloud this and cloud that. Some companies are still holding out, but a huge number of large and small organizations have taken the leap and are using one or more public cloud services.Â

It provides many different services, which are primarily controlled by Microsoft's Azure Portal. The Azure Portal is where all of the Azure services are managed, but it's not the only place through which Azure resources can be managed. Another method is Windows PowerShell.

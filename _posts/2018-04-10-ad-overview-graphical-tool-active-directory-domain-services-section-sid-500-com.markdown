> AD Overview Graphical Tool: Active Directory Domain Services Section

I hesitated for a long time. It’s done, it’s not done… should I add more menus… But at some point it’s over. It has to be published. The following article describes the use of a set of advanced functions. This function presents a menu with a lot of scripts in it. It’s like sconfig, but in relation it’s much more powerful when it comes to Active Directory administration.

The function has grown and grown over time and it’s not a perfect script, but I’m sure it will help many of you out there. If you look inside the script, don’t be afraid of lot’s of Write-Host. Write-Host is not as evil as many say.

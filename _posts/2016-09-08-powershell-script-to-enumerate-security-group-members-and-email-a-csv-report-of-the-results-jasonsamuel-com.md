I needed to write a script to enumerate a couple of security groups containing my XenDesktop VDI users and email an attachment with all the user names on a weekly basis to other Citrix admins. I started writing the script with PowerShell and while Googling a cmdlet came across this post by Brian Gordon:

He did all the work for me! Thanks for this Brian!

> PowerShell: BgInfo Automation script
February 23, 2017 at 9:19 am in BgInfo, Client Hyper-V, Hyper-V, PowerShell, scvmm, VM Template, Windows Server 2016, Windows Sysinternals, WS2016 by Wim Matthyssen

Probably everyone knows the Windows Sysinternals tool BgInfo (currently version 4.21). For those who don’t, it’s a great free tool which captures system information form a workstation or server (probably where it is the most useful) and displays the catched data on the Desktop of that machine. It can show useful information like, DNS settings, used IP Addresses, computer name, domain name, OS version, memory, etc. If you want to read more about this tool you can do so via following link: https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bginfo.aspx

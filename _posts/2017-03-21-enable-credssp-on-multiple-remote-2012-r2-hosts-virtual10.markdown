> Enable CredSSP on multiple remote 2012 R2 hosts
By Manny Sidhu · May 10, 2016 · Hyper-V/SCVMM	· Leave a comment
We know SCVMM requires CredSSP to be enabled on remote hosts so admin credentials can be passed on for scripts/commands to run on those hosts. How can this be done via PowerShell on 2012 R2 hosts?

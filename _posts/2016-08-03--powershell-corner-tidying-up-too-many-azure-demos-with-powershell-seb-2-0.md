> #PowerShell Corner: Tidying up too many #Azure demos with PowerShell
Posted on September 2, 2015 by sebmatthews
Today’s PowerShell corner is brought to you in association with “Saving Money on Azure Storage Inc.” an imaginary consulting company, headquartered in Helsinki, that specialises in ensuring you don’t spend too much on Azure storage when it slowly gets out of hand.

I do a lot of Azure (and Office 365 for that matter) demos. Probably 3 or 4 a week in some form or another and coupled to prep/design of these demos, I create a surprising amount of stuff in my tenancies. One challenge with shoving stuff into Azure tenancies is that at some point, somebody has to pay for the stuff being used. It doesn’t add up to a whole heap, but we’d all rather not pay for services unless absolutely necessary, right?

Anyway, enough preamble. Let’s get down to it.

## Using Citrix NetScaler Gateway internally and externally with a single URL By Jason

Citrix Receiver and StoreFront. The 2 single most important parts of your Citrix environment. These 2 components are the what your users see and interact with every day. You must ensure these are always up to date to take advantage of the latest XenApp and XenDesktop features. Above all, everything has to be easy to use. With StoreFront 2.6 and the most recent Receiver 4.2, you have the ability to create a very impressive user experience. You can use a single URL (single FQDN) to deliver a highly secure NetScaler Gateway powered SSL ICA proxy experience both inside and outside the company that is seamless to your users.

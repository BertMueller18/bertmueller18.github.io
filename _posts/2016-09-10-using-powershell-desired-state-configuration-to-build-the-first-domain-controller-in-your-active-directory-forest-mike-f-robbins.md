> Using PowerShell Desired State Configuration to build the first domain controller in your Active Directory forest

MIKE F ROBBINS FEBRUARY 12, 2015 0
If you’re a frequent reader of the blog articles on this site, then you know that I’ve been working on using Desired State Configuration to build my test lab environment that runs as Hyper-V VM’s on my Windows 8.1 computer.

If you would like to know the current state of my test environment, see the previous blog article: “Creating a Desired State Configuration Resource for Self Signed Certificates“.

The certificate created in last week’s blog has been exported and copied to the Windows 8.1 computer that I’m using to author and apply the DSC configuration from. This is a step that I’ll need to revisit at some point in the future and take a look at automating it.

> HOW TO SECURE POWERSHELL REMOTING IN A WINDOWS DOMAIN
October 27, 2018 0 Comments PowerShell

PowerShell is an awesomely powerful tool for configuring, managing and controlling your environment. Out of the box, PowerShell remoting is very secure but there are enhancements you can make to increase security.

I was recently asked to come up with a security posture for my organization and to communicate that stance to my leaders. I knew PS was secure from the start but I couldn't rely on what I thought, so I needed to dive in and do some research to confirm my opinion of security in PowerShell with respect to remoting.

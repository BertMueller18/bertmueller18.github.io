> Hands off my gold image – Microsoft Deployment Toolkit details

After the corresponding Geek Speak talk at Citrix Synergy in Barcelona, I posted an article on automating a XenApp deployment and capture into Provisioning Services via the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT): Hands off my gold image – Automating Citrix XenApp/PVS Image Creation.

In a series of blog posts I’ll cover some of the steps in more detail – first up is configuring the MDT deployment share. I won’t cover setting up a share here, so if you’re new to MDT, I suggest starting at the MDT home page on TechNet where you’ll find various resources on using MDT.

In order to deploy and service Windows 10 successfully, you need to carefully consider how you apply language packs. In today’s blog post I will discuss the approach that I use to deploy and service Windows 10 in a multi language environment using Microsoft MDT and one base Windows 10 image.

Let's go back a couple of months: In late 2016 I advised two of my customers, who just started transitioning to Windows 10, to get an early start with Windows as a Service. First of all, Windows as a Service, as demo-ed at Ignite, works fantastic – as long as you don't have any language packs installed.

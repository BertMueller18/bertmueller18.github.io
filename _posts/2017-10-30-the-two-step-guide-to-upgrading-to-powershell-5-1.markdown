> THE TWO STEP GUIDE TO UPGRADING TO POWERSHELL 5.1
October 23, 2017	Leave a comment


PowerShell 5.1 has been out now for nearly a year, but I’ve found that many companies have yet to upgrade. Perhaps the reason they haven’t updated is that they’re at PowerShell 5.0 and don’t see the need to upgrade or they’ve built code in the v2 days where they feel like something may break. If you do decide to upgrade, I’ve created a technical how-to with some scripts to automate this process for you. Disclaimer: All code mentioned in this post is as-is. Some may work, some may not work in your environment but, if you have nothing, to begin with, it will act as a template for you to start with.

Since I’d just be repeating what sites like like the PowerShell 5.1 release notes and the installation help that Microsoft provides for 5.1, this isn’t going to be about 5.1’s features but rather a tactical how-to on getting it done once you’ve decided to go there.

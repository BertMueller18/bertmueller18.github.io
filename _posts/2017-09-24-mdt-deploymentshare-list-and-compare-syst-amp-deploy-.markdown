> MDT DeploymentShare List and Compare

 Damien Van Robaeys   15:45 
 
If you work withÂ MDT it could be interesting to list in Excel format what you have in your DeploymentShare. 

In my case I find it much easier to read and I like to search other ways to proceed.

That's why I created a little tool in order to list some content of your DeploymentShare.
Using this tool you can also compare 2 DeploymentShare contents and see differences.

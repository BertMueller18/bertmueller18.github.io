> Direct for Hyper-Converged Infrastructure!
Posted DEC 3 2015 by DANE YOUNG with 0 COMMENTS


In the previous blog post I demonstrated how to build a proof of concept environment using Windows Server 2016 with Hyper-V and Storage Spaces Direct using virtual machines on VMware vSphere. Expanding on the concepts that I covered in the previous post, I’m going to show you how to fully automate the installation and configuration process using Microsoft’s free hypervisor and deployment software, namely Hyper-V Server 2016 and Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT) 2013 Update 1. If you follow the steps in this post, at the end you will have a fully automated, entirely free Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) platform including shared storage using Hyper-V Server and Storage Spaces Direct. Additionally, you’ll have the tools to rinse and repeat as many times as required to deploy in remote pods of infrastructure, or to use for customer deployments if you work at an integration partner as I do.

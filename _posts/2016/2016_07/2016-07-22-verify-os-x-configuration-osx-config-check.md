## Verify OS X Configuration: osx-config-check
CyberPunk » System Administration

Verify OS X Configuration

     osx-config-check checks your OSX machine against various hardened configuration settings. You can specify your own preferred configuration baseline by supplying your own HJson file instead of the provided one.  The authors of this tool are not responsible if running it breaks stuff; disabling features of your operating system and applications may disrupt normal functionality.  Once applied, the security configurations do not not gurantee security. You will still need to make good decisions in order to stay secure. The configurations will generally not help you if your computer has been previously compromised.

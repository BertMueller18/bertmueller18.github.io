## Swiss Army Knife for Mac OS X: m-cli
CyberPunk » System Administration

Swiss Army Knife for Mac OS X

m-cli differs from other mac command line tools in that:

Its main purpose is to manage administrative tasks and do it easier
It doesn’t install 3rd party tools because it doesn’t have dependencies
The installation is very easy and doesn’t require intervention
It only uses OS X commands

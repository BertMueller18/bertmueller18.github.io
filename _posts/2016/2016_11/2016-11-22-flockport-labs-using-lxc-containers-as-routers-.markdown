## Using LXC containers as routers

This is part II of our Flockport labs LXC networking deep dive. In part I we provided an overview of LXC networking and covered extending layer 2 across hosts that may not be in the same network. Please read that first as without the perspective it may be difficult to follow what we are doing here.
LXC containers support multiple network interfaces providing flexibility and allowing for interesting use cases. For instance with 2 interfaces you can use your LXC container as a router.

Whenever there is an issue on the Exchange server we analyze the log files then next we will be moving to check is our Exchange server works under threshold. If not what is the maximum limit it reaches…

For example on going to task manager to check CPU utilization is 100 % or memory is 100 %  – little deeper we will use performance monitor tool.

Thought to share my experince on how to plays with the exchange 2013 counter using powershell which makes job easier and quicker.

For newbies it could be a little bit complicated to start with lability, but this tool is great and you can save a lot of time if you use it – thanks to Iain for his great work!

I wrote this howto for starting with this tool from scratch and to avoid obstackles and errors – if you find mistakes or other useful info, to find it worth to add, pls leave a comment – any feedback appreciated.

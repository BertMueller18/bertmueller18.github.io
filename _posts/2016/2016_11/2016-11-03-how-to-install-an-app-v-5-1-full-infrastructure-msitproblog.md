## How to install an App-V 5.1 Full Infrastructure Simon Dettling  27. October 2015  App-V  47 Comments
In this blog post I want to cover the setup of a new App-V 5.1 Server Infrastructure (Management- & Publishing-Server) from scratch. There are currently a few gotchas which I will cover, that can cause some Confusion if you donâ€™t know them. Regarding the Management Database, I will perform the installation via the SQL Scripts instead of the native installer. The Advantage of this method is that you can use it to place the Management Database on a SQL Cluster.

Below you see a diagram of my servers in my lab environment.

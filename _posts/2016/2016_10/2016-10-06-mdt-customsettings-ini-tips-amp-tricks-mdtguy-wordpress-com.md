If you’re just learning MDT perhaps you’ve have had some time to look at and tweak your customsettings.ini file, or at the very least heard about what this one little file can do to take your deployments to the next level.

The real magic of MDT lies in its flexibility, as its scripts allow us to not only dynamically install and configure an OS, but they give us the ability to automate many, many steps of the MDT 2012 lite touch wizard as well. Granted, getting everything automated does take some work as well as some trial and error, but believe me, it’ll pay off in dividends down the road. Joining 200+ workstations to the domain is tedious and prone to user error. Automate just that one step and you can save hours and hours down the road.

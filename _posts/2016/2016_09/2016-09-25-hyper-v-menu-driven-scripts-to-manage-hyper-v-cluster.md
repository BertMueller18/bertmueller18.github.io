Hyper-V: Menu driven scripts to manage Hyper-V Cluster

By praveshsk in Hyper-V, Windows Server 2012 R2 on September 21, 2016
Here is a collection of scripts I wrote some time back to manage my Hyper-V Cluster.

The scripts, as you can spot has some options missing, which I have left out intentionally for future expansion. The script takes input from a CSV file (depending upon the option selected) and applies the setting/config to the cluster. Thanks to @mannysidhu2 for contributing towards some parts of these scripts

Note: As always – please do test these scripts in a non-production environment before wearing your cowboy hats and running in Production !!

Hope you find it helpful.!

## Quick and easy Active Directory test lab using PowerShell DSC and AzureRM

That Active Directory Test Lab You Have Always Wanted
As a Microsoft Premier Field Engineer I have visited countless customers to assess and assist their Active Directory environment. Sadly, the majority of those customers do not have an Active Directory test environment. Today I am going to show you how to quickly deploy and destroy your own Active Directory test lab using Azure Resource Manager and PowerShell.

Build 10 new AD labs a day if you want. It is crazy easy and crazy fast using this script. Imagine going to your morning status meeting, and then coming back to an Active Directory domain ready for you to do your worst. When you are done, a single line of PowerShell erases the entire environment.

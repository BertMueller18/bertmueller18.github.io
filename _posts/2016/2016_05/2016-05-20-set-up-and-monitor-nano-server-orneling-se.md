## SET UP AND MONITOR NANO SERVER
It´s been a while since I wrote anything now (5 weeks approximately, which is not okay) and it´s time to monitor Nano Server again. Due to some really annoying issues with my lab environment I have had major problems installing the latest technical preview of Windows Server and SCOM. But I decided to have the last laugh and now both Windows Server 2016 and SCOM 2016 are running on TP5 level.

### So what´s new in SCOM 2016 TP5?

Monitor a broad range of network devices without requiring Operations Manager certification
Monitor Nano Server deployments, including DNS and IIS roles
Realize more than 2X scale improvement in monitoring UNIX/Linux servers
Experience a more responsive application console, including the ability to navigate across different views and pivots without having to wait for the data to load
Seamlessly discover, install and update required management packs right from the administration console
Tune management packs, and alter the monitors and alerting rules – either at source level or group level – to reduce alert noise
Plan and schedule maintenance windows for workloads without generating spurious alerts in Operations Manager console
Utilize the Preferred Partner program to discover third-party management packs, authoring tools, dashboard utilities, etc., right from the Operations Manager console

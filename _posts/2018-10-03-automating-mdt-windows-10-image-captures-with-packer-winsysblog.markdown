> Automating MDT Windows 10 Image Captures with Packer
May 18, 2018 Dan Franciscus 0 Comment Technical
So to be up front, this is not a tutorial for setting up Packer to capture images to MDT, it is more of a postmortem on my experience doing so. There was a lot of trial and error involved in this, and my memory sucks so the exact steps involved are not here. If you want to do it, I recommend cloning Stefanâ€™s Git repo first, and then modify to what you need. That is what I did.

> Viewing open files on a file server from powershell.

So this is a situation you should all be aware of in an SBC / VDI environment, despite all warnings, youâ€™ve redirected folders to your network drive and your file servers are screaming in agony?

Having been in this situation recently, I needed to audit and report on the types of files open on the file server, my hunch was a certain select number of users were running applications (like *gulp* lotus notes) from the network share.

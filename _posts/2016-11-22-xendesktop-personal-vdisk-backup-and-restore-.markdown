## XenDesktop Personal VDisk Backup andÂ Restore

Citrix have an detailed article on Managing Personal Vdisks and backing up and restoring them.
This is detailed in the E-docs here

The following shows the process used by RealServe IT in our labs to test the process.
This process is designed to help move a users Personal Vdisk to another catalog.
This could be used to migrate users to a newer environment or recover from a failure.
Essentialy the scripts attach the users personal Vdisk to another Virtual Machine.

The document says the personal Vdisk can only be moved however to a catalog with a master related to the original catalog the Vdisk started life from. This could limit the flexibilty of this process. &#x2014;[XenDesktop Personal VDisk Backup and Restore | ](https://realserveit.wordpress.com/2014/08/19/xendesktop-personal-vdisk-backup-and-restore/)

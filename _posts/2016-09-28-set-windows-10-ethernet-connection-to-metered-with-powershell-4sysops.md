If you set your internet connection to metered, Windows will limit automatic downloads such as Windows Update. Whereas a Wi-Fi connection can be set to a metered connection easily with a few mouse clicks, things are a bit more complicated with an Ethernet connection. I wrote a little PowerShell script that allows quick switching between metered and not metered connections.

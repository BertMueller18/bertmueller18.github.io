> PowerShell w/o PowerShell Simplified
Brian Ferman//



In a previous post, titled PowerShell without PowerShell, we showed you how you can bypass Application Whitelisting Software (AWS), PowerShell restrictions/monitoring, and Command Prompt restrictions. In some cases, you might not need all of that; you might just need a way to bypass PowerShell restrictions and/or monitoring. This post presents a simple solution for the aforementioned scenario. This approach is not new but this post attempts to present it in a plain, straight-forward way.Â

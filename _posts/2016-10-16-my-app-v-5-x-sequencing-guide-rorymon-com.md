> My App-V 5.x Sequencing Guide
Post on: Aug 25, 2016  Rorymon 

Tim Mangan recently posted a great blog series to help you get started with App-V 5.x, one of these posts covers sequencing: http://www.tmurgent.com/TmBlog/?p=2501. He covers theory, tools and his own practices. Check that post out! I created this document a couple of months ago for the organization I’m working for, so I figured I’d also share my own!

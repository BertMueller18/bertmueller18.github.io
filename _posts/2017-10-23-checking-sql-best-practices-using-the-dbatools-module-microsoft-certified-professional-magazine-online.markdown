> Checking SQL Best Practices Using the DBATools Module
With the help of this extremely useful PowerShell module, you'll be able to ensure that all your SQL-based servers are optimized.

By Boe Prox02/20/2017
The PowerShell community is a treasure trove of amazing modules and scripts that you can find online and use in your day-to-day operations. It doesn't matter the platform or the purpose, there is probably a script that you can use out there somewhere. In the case of SQL, this is definitely no different. One such module that has been developed by the community is called DBATools and is described as a best practices module with a lot of other useful commands also available. The module was started by Chrissy LeMaire (blog | twitter) and has had others in the community involved in making this an amazing module to have in your toolkit. They are actively accepting feedback as well as any bugs found and features that you would like to see in the module.

The first thing that we need to do is bring the module down to our system. If you are running PowerShell V5, you can use Install-Module to download and install the module from the PowerShell Gallery. Otherwise you can download the module from the GitHub page.

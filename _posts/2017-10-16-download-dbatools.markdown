We subscribe to idea that developers should release early and release often. dbatools has been around since 2014 but is still in prerelease (0.9.x). It’s been tested by hundreds if not thousands of people and each release gets better and better because of your early suggestions, bug reports and feedback.

We plan for version 1.0 to be gorgeous and standardized. This means that we’ll be introducing breaking changes by fixing our bad habits (inconsistent parameter names, etc). We’re unsure when 1.0 will be finalized but will announce it on our blog when it is.

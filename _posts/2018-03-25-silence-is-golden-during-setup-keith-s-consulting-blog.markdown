> Silence is Golden during Setup
7
Thanks to @gwblok for pointing me to this twitter thread about Windows OOBE Setup.

When Unattended is not Silent
During Windows 10 OOBE, the Windows Welcome process uses the Cortana voice engine to speak during Windows Setup.

Now we can go look for any updates

Shut up!

Yes, I’m one of those guys who sets my Sound Profile to “silent”, Silence is Golden!

And if I’m going to be running several Windows Deployments in my lab (read my home office), then I would prefer the machine to be silent. Reminds me of the XP/Vista days when we had boot up sounds. How rude.

So how to disable… Well the answer doesn’t appear to be that straight forwards.

## PowerShell and XML
Introduction to how easy PowerShell makes working with XML programmatically
Introduction
XML is everywhere. As a result, many of us find the need to work with XML and traditional text editors don't cut it. Some editors provide decent formatting (like Notepad++), but they don't provide a mechanism to examine the underlying data in the XML programmatically.

PowerShell makes handling XML very simple. It converts XML elements to properties on .NET objects without the need to write any parsing code. So all you need is PowerShell installed on your machine and you're ready to go!

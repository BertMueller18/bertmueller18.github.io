Overview
Explains how to configure Microsoft Outlook to use the global address book on the server instead of a locally cached copy.

Goal
After completing this tutorial you will have configured Microsoft Outlook to always reference the latest version of the global address book directly from the email server rather than referencing a downloaded local copy.

 

Warning!
After following these steps, you will only be able to access the global address book while Outlook is connected to the server. While in Offline mode you will have to enter the full email address for any recipient that isn't saved in your contacts list.

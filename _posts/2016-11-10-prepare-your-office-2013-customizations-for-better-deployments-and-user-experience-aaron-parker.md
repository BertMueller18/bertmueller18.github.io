> Prepare your Office 2013 Customizations for Better Deployments and User Experience

Investing time into customising the deployment of Office 2013 is essential for providing a well managed deployment and the best out-of-box user experience. If you’re deploying a Windows Installer-based installation of Office 2013, you’ll need to customise the installation using the Office Customization Tool.

User settings that might impact the default Office experience or may require special consideration in your environment, are worth investing in planning time because you’ll often have only one chance to get deployment right.

> Docker Home Server for Raspberry Pi
bingen (25) in raspberrypi •  5 months ago
Introduction
I ran my first home Virtual Private Server around 2001. Mostly e-mail, with some mailing lists for me and my friends, and web too. Since then I have been adding some services like DNS, LDAP, XMPP, Wordpress and more recently Owncloud/Nextcloud. I was always using old desktop boxes that I was not using anymore. Actually, the first one was an old 486! And it was working flawlessly. The fact that I was never using cutting edge hardware made me think that RaspberryPi could be a good option. Besides, it was always annoying when this old 24/7 running stuff was dying (most of the times hard drives, although at some point I added RAID), to have to reinstall everything from scratch (and the disruption in my own services), so I thought that I needed some automation, and I had been long time willing to dig deeper into Docker.

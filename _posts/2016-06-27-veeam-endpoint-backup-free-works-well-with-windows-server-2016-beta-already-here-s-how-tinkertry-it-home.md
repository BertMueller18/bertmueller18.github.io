## Veeam Endpoint Backup FREE works well with Windows Server 2016 (beta) already, here's how

I actually enjoy playing around with beta code, because I like getting a peek at where things are headed. I also enjoy hitting the ground running, when the final product finally arrives. For over a decade now, in my home the family's PCs tend to be at the very latest OS level, usually a month or two before generally available. Same goes for my MSDN Windows Server tests that I do in my home lab.

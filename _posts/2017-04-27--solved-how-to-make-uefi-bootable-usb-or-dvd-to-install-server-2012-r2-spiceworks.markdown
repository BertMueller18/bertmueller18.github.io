I believe to make a usb bootable for UEFI it has to be FAT32

So you could open CMD and run this:

diskpart

list disk

select disk # (# is the value that represents your USB)

clean

create partition primary

select partition 1

format fs=fat32 quick

active

exit

Hopefully this is what you were looking for.Â

> AD FS deployment in Azure
3.10.2016 16 min to read Contributors    
AD FS provides simplified, secured identity federation and Web single sign-on (SSO) capabilities. Federation with Azure AD or O365 enables users to authenticate using on-premises credentials and access all resources in cloud. As a result, it becomes important to have a highly available AD FS infrastructure to ensure access to resources both on-premises and in the cloud. Deploying AD FS in Azure can help achieve the high availability required with minimal efforts. There are several advantages of deploying AD FS in Azure, a few of them are listed below:

High Availability - With the power of Azure Availability Sets, you ensure a highly available infrastructure.
Easy to Scale – Need more performance? Easily migrate to more powerful machines by just a few clicks in Azure
Cross-Geo Redundancy – With Azure Geo Redundancy you can be assured that your infrastructure is highly available across the globe
Easy to Manage – With highly simplified management options in Azure portal, managing your infrastructure is very easy and hassle-free

You really just want a clean mandatory profile if you are deploying AppSense on Windows 7 or Server 2008 R2. The vast majority of companies don’t need to customize it. When you get into customization, you’re going to go through a lot of trouble trying to clean up the profile. Save yourself the trouble. The best thing to do is have a clean and slim mandatory profile that can be applied to any server or desktop in your environment and leverage AppSense itself to do everything else.

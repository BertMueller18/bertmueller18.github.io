## Who said that OpenStack is complicated to deploy?
v-magine spins up a full working OpenStack environment in less than an hour.
Use it to test a proof-of-concept or deploy it on a full scale enterprise datacenter!
It doesn’t matter if you have a Windows 8 laptop or an entire Hyper-V server 2012 R2 rack!
